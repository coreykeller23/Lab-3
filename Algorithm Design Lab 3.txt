Problem Description: Create a program that uses functions to find the area of a circle, volume of a cylinder, and area of a rectangle. The program should create 3 different functions that can be called and use parameters to define the radius and height (for the cylinder). The function for finding the area of a circle should be called within the function for finding the volume of a cylinder. The function for finding the area of a rectangle will have 2 parameters.

Algorithm Design:

Step 1: Import the math python file to use the pi variable

Step 2: Create variables for the dimensions of the shapes. There will need to be two differnet radii (one for the circle and one for the cylinder), a height for the cylinder, a length for the rectangle, and the width of the rectangle.

Step 3: Define the functions associated with the shapes that return area of a circle named "areCircle", volume of a cylinder called "volCylinder", and the area of a rectangle called "areaRectangle". When defining the volCylinder, call the function for the area of a circle.

Step 4: Print statements that call each function using the variables created earlier as the arguments in the parameters.
